            Teacher turnover has increased substantially over the past two
            decades: 5.1% of public school teachers left the workforce in 1992,
            while 8.4% left in 2005. This 3% increase amounts to about 90,000
            additional teachers needing to be hired across the U.S. each year.

            Teachers are most likely to quit in their first few years, a study
            by the US Department of Education‚Äôs National Center for Education
            Statistics (NCES) found that 17 percent of new teachers leave their
            jobs within the first five years of teaching. What makes such
            statistics troubling is the evidence that high teacher turnover
            negatively affects student achievement. <br />
            <br />Turnover rates are shown to be higher in schools with more
            students of color and students from low-income families. This also
            disproportionately impacts students who are English language
            learners.

            This project initially focused on getting artists and other creative
            professionals to work with schools to create educational
            opportunities for students and teaching opportunities for those
            creative professionals. After beginning my research and performing
            interviews,<br /><br />
            I found that my initial focus of providing students with these new
            "resources" (creative professionals) may not be the real issue that
            I want to target. Based on research and interviews, I pivoted to
            focus on helping career teachers become better teachers. By viewing
            teachers as the real "resouces" students need, I could more directly
            impact students.

          <p class="flex-paragraph">
            Teacher coaches in "Teach for America" interviewed said that new
            teachers struggled most with creating lesson plans engaging and
            hitting all the necessary points to create an effective classroom
            experience. <br /><br />So I designed a simple lesson plan template
            that requires teachers to write out the specific aspects of their
            lesson. This template takes the mental load off of teachers when
            creating lessons and allows them to spend more time being creative
            with the content of the lessons.

          <p class="flex-paragraph">
            Based on my conversations with educators and educator coaches, I
            found that being reflective of your teaching helps make a teacher
            better. After learning this, I decided that including a place for
            teachers to have an interactive virtual "coaching" conversation
            would be helpful. I designed a basic chatbot that focuses on
            open-ended questions allowing users to talk through their day and
            review what went well and what did not.

            Teachers being able to share their thoughts and plans with others in
