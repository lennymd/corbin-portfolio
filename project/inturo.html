                Teacher turnover has increased substantially over the past two
                decades: 5.1% of public school teachers left the workforce in
                1992, while 8.4% left in 2005. This 3% increase amounts to about
                90,000 additional teachers needing to be hired across the U.S.
                each year.

            Teachers are most likely to quit in their first few years, a study
            by the US Department of Education‚Äôs National Center for Education
            Statistics (NCES) found that 17 percent of new teachers leave their
            jobs within the first five years of teaching. What makes such
            statistics troubling is the evidence that high teacher turnover
            negatively affects student achievement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turnover rates are shown to be higher in schools with more students
            of color and students from low-income families. This also
            disproportionately impacts students who are English language
            learners.

            This project initially focused on getting artists and other creative
            professionals to work with schools to create educational
            opportunities for students and teaching opportunities for those
            creative professionals. After beginning my research and performing
            interviews,
          </p>
          <p>
            I found that my initial focus of providing students with these new
            "resources" (creative professionals) may not be the real issue that
            I want to target. Based on research and interviews, I pivoted to
            focus on helping career teachers become better teachers. By viewing
            teachers as the real "resources" students need, I could more
            directly impact students.
